          This is our attempt to become profficient in full stack web application development. We are using Java for developing backend
          and React for front end. Angular is also a choice for front end development, initial familiarity with React was
          the deciding factor.

          Google Reader was one of my facorite application that was unfortunately discotinued by Google. We are trying to recreate
          a similar application which we hope will catapult our career to higher orbits.
